# WP-5D — Production Parity Completion (Founder Option B) v1.0

**Status:** ACTIVE — COMPLETED (canonical `pf1` recovered & committed; production overlay documented; parity closed to canonical scope). Companion certificate: REPO-CERT-005.
**Version:** v1.0
**Date:** 2026-07-13
**Placement:** docs/project-history/work-packages/[ACTIVE]_WP-5D_Production_Parity_Completion_v1.0.md
**Supersedes:** the open recommendations of [ACTIVE]_WP-5D_Production_Parity_Recovery_v1.0 (the WP-5D investigation; retained as history). Per Founder Option B this is the single consolidated completion package.
**Dependencies:** WP-5D investigation set (Evidence Register, Engineering Decision Log, Validation Report, Production Parity Report, REPO-CERT-004) — referenced, not duplicated; WP-5F2 execution; migrations 008/010/019/023.

> **Documentation note (why this is consolidated):** Per the Founder's Option B instruction, all engineering evidence, validation, decisions, parity, verification and conclusions are embedded here in one document. Separate sub-reports were **not** created. The **only** separate artifact is the execution certificate (REPO-CERT-005), because CLAUDE.md governance explicitly requires a companion certificate before a Work Package may read COMPLETED. The verbatim recovered SQL and full introspection evidence already live in the committed [ACTIVE]_WP-5D_Evidence_Register_v1.0; this document references rather than re-pastes it.

## 1. Founder Decision (final)

**Option B approved.** `rls_auto_enable()`, `ensure_rls`, and the postgres-owned automatic-RLS behaviour are a **Production Operational Overlay** and **SHALL NOT** become canonical repository objects. The repository remains the canonical engineering source of truth and must rebuild correctly without them. This decision supersedes every unresolved WP-5D recommendation.

## 2. Canonical `pf1` — recovered & committed

**File:** `database/migrations/029_pf1_security_hardening.sql` (+ paired `database/rollback/029_pf1_security_hardening_rollback.sql`).
**Identity:** production ledger `pf1_security_hardening`, version `20260710101630`. Recovered **verbatim** from `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations.statements` (HIGH confidence — exact applied SQL). Ordinal `029_` continues the repo convention (as `027_`/`028_` did for their bare ledger names).

**Engineering intent preserved:** Finding 1 (lock `fn_assign_tag_vector_positions` to service_role + pin search_path); Finding 2 (complete migration-008 AGR-001 by revoking INSERT/REFERENCES on the derived `dishes` columns in addition to UPDATE); Finding 3 (revoke PUBLIC/anon/authenticated EXECUTE on the 3 trigger functions, grant service_role only); Finding 4 (pin search_path on the trigger functions).

### 2.1 Quarantine (the single Option-B exclusion)
Production `pf1` also contained:
```sql
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.rls_auto_enable() FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated;
```
- **Why quarantined:** `public.rls_auto_enable()` is a production operational-overlay object (see §3); it exists in no canonical migration, so this statement would error in a clean repository rebuild.
- **How:** the line is **retained as a comment** in `029_…sql` (not deleted), with inline evidence, the Founder Option-B reference, and its operational dependency documented.
- **Evidence:** exact SQL and provenance in [ACTIVE]_WP-5D_Evidence_Register_v1.0 §2/§4.
- **Founder approval:** Option B (this document §1).
- **Operational dependency:** on production only, the overlay owner applies that REVOKE as part of the same operational hardening; it is intentionally out of canonical scope.
- **Result:** every other `pf1` statement is canonical and executes cleanly (verified §4).

### 2.2 Effectiveness (measured, not assumed)
Clean-room (fresh PostgreSQL 15, Supabase-compat bootstrap) after building 001→029:
- `anon` EXECUTE on `fn_derive_dish_attributes` → **false**; `service_role` → **true**; search_path → `public, pg_catalog`. ✅
- `public.dishes` derived column `diet_type` for `authenticated`: **col_UPDATE / col_INSERT / tbl_UPDATE / tbl_INSERT = false**, **col_SELECT = true**.

This is a material improvement over WP-5F2 (which, at 001–028 only, measured `authenticated` col_UPDATE = **true**). So `pf1` **actively closes** the WP-5F2 / WP-04DA "Sixth Finding" GRANT-level gap on the derived columns (read retained, write removed), on top of the RLS default-deny that WP-5F2 already proved protects row data. Recovering `pf1` therefore hardens the canonical repository, not just documents production.

## 3. Production Operational Overlay — documentation (Option B, embedded)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Objects** | `public.rls_auto_enable()` (event-trigger function, SECURITY DEFINER, owner `postgres`) + `ensure_rls` event trigger (`ON ddl_command_end`, owner `postgres`, `EXECUTE FUNCTION rls_auto_enable()`). |
| **Purpose** | Defensive automation: auto-enables Row Level Security on every newly-created `public` table at DDL time, so no table is ever accidentally left RLS-disabled. |
| **History** | Created out-of-band in production (no migration provenance — `migrations_creating = null`); referenced only by `pf1`. Postgres-owned, i.e. added manually/operationally, not via the tracked migration pipeline. |
| **Behaviour** | On `CREATE TABLE`/`CREATE TABLE AS`/`SELECT INTO` in `public`, runs `ALTER TABLE … ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Enabling RLS without a policy = default-deny (service_role bypasses). |
| **Difference vs repo** | Measured: production has RLS enabled on **33** public tables vs a canonical repo build's **20** (+13 = 7 internal audit tables + 6 partition children). This **diverges from the frozen migration-019 design**, which deliberately leaves internal audit tables without RLS. Policies (24) and base tables (62) are identical. |
| **Reason for exclusion** | Founder Option B: it changes the frozen migration-019 RLS design; adopting it as canonical would be an architecture change. It is operational, not engineering-canonical. |
| **Future maintenance** | Owned and maintained operationally on production by the overlay owner, outside the migration pipeline. If a future engineer sees RLS on tables migration 019 didn't enable, this overlay is why. |
| **Founder decision** | Option B — remain operational, never canonical (this document §1). |
| **Future engineering rule** | Do not add `rls_auto_enable`/`ensure_rls` (or equivalent auto-RLS event triggers) to `database/migrations`. Canonical RLS is defined exclusively and explicitly by migration 019 (+021 for cuisines). Any future canonical RLS change is a normal, numbered migration. |

## 4. Repository Verification (STEP 3, execution-backed)

Clean-room (disposable local PostgreSQL 15, never production) — full results:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Build 001→029 (unseeded) | ✅ 29/29 apply cleanly (029 included) |
| Teardown 029→001 | ✅ 29/29 reverse cleanly; end state **0 base tables, `re_engine` dropped** |
| Migration chain | ✅ contiguous 001–029, no renumbering of 001–028 |
| Rollback chain | ✅ **29/29** paired (invariant preserved; was 28/28) |
| Seed layer | ✅ unchanged (100–102; SEED-01 fix from WP-5E intact) |
| Validation layer | ✅ unchanged (900–904) |
| Architecture / freeze | ✅ untouched — overlay deliberately not introduced |
| Governance / naming / versioning | ✅ `029_pf1_security_hardening.sql` matches SQL naming (NNN_description, no status/version); docs use `[ACTIVE]_…_vX.Y.md` |
| Cross-references | ✅ 029 headers cite migrations 008/010/023, WP-5D evidence, Option B |
| Self-containment / rebuildability | ✅ repo rebuilds with **no** dependency on the operational overlay |
| Developer onboarding | ✅ overlay divergence now documented (§3) so a new engineer is not surprised by production RLS state |

Nothing introduced by WP-5D breaks repository integrity.

## 5. Production Parity (STEP 4, final — every difference classified)

| Item | Classification | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Migrations 001–026 | Canonical | Parity ✅ |
| 027/028 (repo ordinals vs bare ledger names) | Canonical (naming convention) | Parity ✅ (cosmetic filename note; no rename performed — needs Founder authorization) |
| `pf1_security_hardening` → `029_pf1_security_hardening` | Canonical | **Parity ✅ (now committed)** |
| `rls_auto_enable()` + `ensure_rls` + auto-RLS on +13 tables | **Operational Overlay** | Excluded by Option B; documented §3 ✅ |
| `103_production_cuisines` | **Illustrative/Environment-Specific Data** | Excluded (production seed data; repo uses illustrative 100–102 per IDR-001) ✅ |
| `103_production_ingredients` | **Illustrative/Environment-Specific Data** | Excluded (same) ✅ |

**No remaining difference is unexplained.** Schema parity: base tables 62=62, policies 24=24 ✅. Security parity: `pf1` canonical content now in repo ✅; the RLS-enablement delta is fully attributed to the Operational Overlay. Functions/constraints/indexes: identical at the migration level (a byte-level `pg_dump` diff is a WP-5G live-cert activity).

- **Canonical migration parity: 29 / 29 = 100%** (all canonical engineering migrations now in the repo).
- Non-canonical production artifacts (overlay + production data seeds) are classified and intentionally excluded.

## 6. Repository Completeness Assessment (STEP 5)

| Dimension | State | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Migration completeness | ✅ 100% canonical (001–029) | execution-proven |
| Rollback completeness | ✅ 29/29 | execution-proven teardown to empty |
| Documentation completeness | ✅ | lean; WP history + KNOWLEDGE current |
| Architecture completeness | ✅ | frozen; overlay boundary documented |
| Governance completeness | ✅ | naming/versioning/certificate rules honoured |
| Engineering completeness | ✅ | build→seed→validate→teardown all proven (WP-5F2 + this WP) |
| Developer readiness | ✅ | self-contained rebuild; overlay caveat documented |
| Knowledge preservation | ✅ | KNOWLEDGE Sessions 1–9 |
| Operational readiness | ⚠️ deferred | live/prod certification is WP-5G scope |
| Maintainability / integrity | ✅ | no hidden behaviour; every prod difference classified |

## 7. Standards Check (STEP 7)

Filenames, status prefixes (`[ACTIVE]`), version (`v1.0`), SQL naming (`029_pf1_security_hardening.sql` / `…_rollback.sql`), placement (migrations/, rollback/, work-packages/, certificates/), and cross-references all conform. No unrelated historical files renamed.

## 8. Conclusion

Founder Option B is fully executed. The single canonical gap (`pf1`) is recovered, committed, and clean-room-verified; the production operational overlay is documented and deliberately excluded; every production difference is classified with no unexplained residue. Canonical engineering parity is **100%**. The repository is the complete engineering source of truth and rebuilds deterministically without any production-only object.

## 9. Founder Decision section

No new architectural contradiction, no unexpected production difference, no integrity uncertainty, and no competing interpretation remained open after Option B — so no further Founder decision is required for WP-5D. (Any future adoption of the overlay, or the 027/028 filename normalization, would each be a separate, explicitly-authorized action.)

## Critical Self-Review

- **Considered** committing `pf1` verbatim including the `rls_auto_enable` REVOKE. **Rejected** — it would break clean rebuild; Option B + quarantine is the correct resolution.
- **Considered** dropping the quarantined line entirely. **Rejected** — the brief requires retaining it (commented) with rationale, so provenance is not lost.
- **Considered** re-pasting all verbatim SQL/evidence here. **Rejected** — it already exists in the committed WP-5D Evidence Register; duplication contradicts the lean directive.
- **Limitation:** parity is asserted at migration + key-object level with clean-room execution; a full byte-level production `pg_dump` diff is intentionally left to WP-5G.
